Zip can not only create new archives but also manipulate old ones (deleting, updating entries etc.)
this is not included by choice. This is something that conflicts with the deterministic part ;)

Also flags like `-x` for excluding metadata are not available because there is no metadata by design.

You miss a super important flag for you? Simply create an issue (or even create a PR).
